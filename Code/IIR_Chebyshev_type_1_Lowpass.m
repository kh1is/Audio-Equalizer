% Chebyshev Type I Lowpass filter designed using FDESIGN.LOWPASS.

% All frequency values are in Hz.
Fs = fs;  % Sampling Frequency

N     = n;   % Order
Fpass = fpass;  % Passband Frequency
Apass = 1;     % Passband Ripple (dB)

% Construct an FDESIGN object and call its CHEBY1 method.
h  = fdesign.lowpass('N,Fp,Ap', N, Fpass, Apass, Fs);
Hd = design(h, 'cheby1');
